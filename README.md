# Income-Classification
In Income Classification.ipynb" I have implemented different types of supervised algorithms which predict the salary class of the person or employee either is greater than 50k$ or less than 50K$. I have done label-encoding techniques, how to validate the model and implemented the GridSearch to select the best accuracy model.This income classification model is based on different features like fnlwgt, education, occupation, capital-gain, capital-loss, income, and hours-per-week, etc
<p>The income classification model is done with <b>python (sklearn, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)</b>.
